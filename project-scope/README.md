# 1. Problem Statement

## 1.1 Validator Operations and Limitations

Ethereum validators are responsible for proposing and attesting to new blocks in the blockchain. They interact with the network through three main components:

1. **Execution Client**: Handles transaction execution and state management.
2. **Consensus Client**: Manages the proof-of-stake protocol and block proposals.
3. **Validator Client**: Manages keys and signing operations for block proposals and attestations.

Validators communicate with other nodes to stay synchronized with the network state, participate in consensus, and propagate new blocks and attestations.

### Limitations and Risks:

The primary limitation in scaling validator setups comes from the risk of slashing. Slashing is a penalty mechanism designed to discourage validator misbehavior, particularly Double Signing.
Simple replication of validator setups can lead to inadvertent slashing if multiple instances of the same validator key are active simultaneously. This creates a significant challenge in designing high-availability systems for validators.

## 1.2 The Challenge: Cost-Effective and Highly Available Ethereum Validator Setup

Given the operations and limitations described above, our challenge is to design, implement, and document a highly available Ethereum validator setup on the Holesky Testnet that is both cost-effective and robust, while mitigating the risks of slashing.

This task encompasses several key components:

1. Deploying at least one Ethereum validator on the Holesky Testnet
2. Ensuring high availability with automatic failover mechanisms that prevent double signing
3. Optimizing for cost-effectiveness in a cloud environment
